Some personal tests, and test for ideas to be implemented on oVirt open source project (I am a maintainer of the engine-core).
oVirt (open source project for virtualizaion management over KVM) can be found at www.ovirt.org
The current oVirt related test deals with an idea to insert annotation based Transaction scoping into the code, which is command pattern based.
